# interactive-quiz

An engaging interactive quiz application that challenges users with 15 randomized questions, tracks time, validates inputs, and displays the final score. This project is designed to be user-friendly while enforcing rules for fair play.

# Features

1. Start Option - A clear and simple "Start" button to begin the quiz.
2. Total of 15 Questions and Answers - The quiz consists of 15 questions with 4 answer options each.
3. Question Options - Each question presents 4 options, of which only one is correct.
4. Next Button - After selecting an answer, users click the "Next" button to proceed to the next question.
5. Validation for Answer Selection - If an answer is not selected, the quiz does not proceed to the next question, ensuring user input.
6. Single-Answer Rule - Users can select only one answer per question; multiple answers are not allowed.
7. Time Limit - Each question has a 15-second timer. If the timer runs out, the quiz ends, and the user must restart from the beginning.

- Correct Answer: Displays in green.
- Wrong Answer: Displays in red.
9. Final Score - At the end of the quiz, users are shown their score (e.g., "You answered X out of 15 questions correctly").
